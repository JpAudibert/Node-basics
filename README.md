# Node-basics
A node BR's course to start developing with Node JS, tought by Erick Wendel

This is a very good specialization course. It's fenomenal! i'm learning a lot of
NodeJS, from the very beginning, until some advanced features, like security and 
documentation (something very important while API developper).

I'm sure if someone ask me of this course is good, certeanly, I would recomend it.

This is the repository from it, every thing  learnt there, is passed to here, with
a little bit of my way of solving problems. Feel free to look at it, and as I've done
learn with it!
